<h3> Basic First Aid</h3>
    <h4> Burns </h4>
    <div>
    Minor burns appear red and swollen. Unless they involve a large portion of the body, you can treat these at home by first flushing the area with cool water for several minutes, covering the area with a sterile bandage or cloth and using an over-thecounter pain reliever. Moderate burns are intensely red in color and will begin to blister. Follow the same first aid procedures as for minor burns and seek medical attention. Severe burns may be charred black or dried white. Nerve damage may result in no pain in the most severly affected areas. Remove the patient from the source of the burning without endangering yourself and Call emergency services immediately. Remove any smoldering clothing and jewelry which may still be hot or may cut off circulation when hands and feet swell. Cover the burned area with a cool/moist sterile bandage or cloth. Do not apply any creams, ointments or ice, and do not break blisters. Be careful - you want to cool the burning but not the patient. Burnt skin will prevent the body from properly controlling its temperature and the patient can become hypothermic even during the summer.

<h4> Choking </h4>
<div>
If the person’s airway is only partially obstructed, they will still be able to speak short sentences and cough. Encourage them to continue but do nothing else. However, if the airway becomes completely blocked the person will not be able to speak or cough and will need your help. Stand behind the choking person and wrap your hands around their abdomen. Make a fist with one hand and place it just above their navel. With your other hand, grasp your fist and press in and up with a quick, forceful thrust until the obstruction is relieved.

<h4> Eye Injuries </h4>
<div> Impaled objects - Do not attempt to remove the object. Instead, surround the object with large bulky dressings so that the object does not move. Also, 
While these basic first aid tips can be useful, they are not a substitute for a hands-on class. 

The Springfield First Aid Squad is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing emergency medical treatment & ambulance transportation to those that live, work or just pass through our town. New volunteers are always in need; no prior experience is required as the Squad will provide the training. Donations are equally welcome as, without the community’s support, the Squad would not be able to operate.
cover both eyes. Even if just one eye is injured, the two eyes move together and can cause further injury. • Foreign debris - Debris such as dirt, sand, and sawdust can cause blinking and tearing which will help flush the substance from the eyes. If the object remains, turn the head to the side and flush with water from the bridge of the nose letting the water run off of the opposite cheek.

<h4> Poisoning </h4>
<div>

Poisoning can be accidental or intentional, and can be through contact (ingesting, inhaling, injecting or touching) with a dangerous substance or simply having too much of something that is normally safe. If you know what poisoned the patient, follow the instructions on the container. 

</div>

<h4> Seizures </h4>
<div>  
Try to keep the area around the patient clear of any objects that could injure further. If possible, loosen tight clothing. Once the seizure ends, try to have the patient lay on his or her side and reassure him or her. Do not put anything in the patient’s mouth, whether to protect the tongue or food or drink. Do not restrain the patient. If the patient has only one seizure and has a history of seizures, he or she may not want any further medical care. However, a first-time seizure, one seizure lasting more than five minutes and multiple seizures all require medical attention.
